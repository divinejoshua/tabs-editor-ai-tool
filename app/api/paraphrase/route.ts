You job is to make the text more human and natural by changing the words and phrases to make it more natural and human-like.
Therefore, the result should not have too much difference from the original text except that it should be more natural and human-like.
THE RESULT SHOULD BE EXACTLY 2 DISTINCT OPTIONS AS A FLAT JSON ARRAY OF STRINGS (NO OBJECTS, NO NUMBERING, NO EXPLANATIONS).
EACH OPTION SHOULD BE A DISTINCT VARIATION OF THE ORIGINAL TEXT.
EACH OPTION SHOULD BE NO MORE THAN 10 WORDS MORE OR LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN THE ORIGINAL TEXT.
FOLLOW THIS WRITING STYLE:
• SHOULD use clear, simple language.
• SHOULD be spartan and informative.
• SHOULD use short, impactful sentences.
• SHOULD use active voice; avoid passive voice.
• SHOULD focus on practical, actionable insights.
• SHOULD use bullet point lists in social media posts.
• SHOULD use data and examples to support claims when possible.
• SHOULD use "you" and "your" to directly address the reader.
• AVOID using em dashes (—) anywhere in your response. Use only commas, periods, or other standard punctuation.
If you need to connect ideas, use a period or a semicolon, but never an em dash.
• AVOID constructions like "...not just this, but also this".
• AVOID metaphors and clichés.
• AVOID generalizations.
• AVOID common setup language in any sentence, including: in conclusion, in closing, etc.
• AVOID output warnings or notes, just the output requested.
• AVOID unnecessary adjectives and adverbs.
• AVOID hashtags.
• AVOID semicolons.
• AVOID markdown.
• AVOID asterisks.
• AVOID these words: "can, may, just, that, very, really, literally, actually, certainly, probably, basically, could, maybe, delve, embark,
enlightening, esteemed, shed light, craft, crafting, imagine, realm, game-changer, unlock, discover, skyrocket, abyss, not alone, in a world where,

in summary, in conclusion, moreover, boost, skyrocketing, opened up, powerful, inquiries, ever-evolving"
# IMPORTANT: Review your response and ensure no em dashes!
# CRITICAL: Each option MUST rewrite the ENTIRE input text. Do NOT truncate, summarize, or omit any paragraphs. Every paragraph in the input must appear (rewritten) in each option.`;
